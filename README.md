# UnsupervisedImageSegmentation
1) Increase the number of epochs in the representation learning and clustering phases, 2) enable the encoder weights to be modified during the clustering phase, and 3) execute a final fine-tuning step by self-labeling, as stated in the original SCAN study, to enhance the accuracy results. Unsupervised image clustering approaches are not anticipated to surpass supervised image classification techniques in terms of accuracy; rather, they are required to demonstrate that they can understand the semantics of pictures and arrange them into clusters that are comparable to their original classes.
